# Transatlantic-Cruisr

An app which allows a user to view and compare information on transatlantic cruises.


## How to Use

User opens application via the Heroku [link](https://transatlantic-cruisr.herokuapp.com) to the homepage and clicks "Discover" to go to the page featuring a series of tabs. There's a Home tab to explain the workings of the site, and the other apps open up to reveal the available cruise schedules and other information from five shipping companines which offer transatlantic service - Cunard, Holland-America, Royal Caribbean, Princess Cruises, and P&O.
